<h1>Exploring Existing Services</h1>
<p>This guide provides comprehensive steps on how to navigate through various services available in the Store, import them into your project, and deploy them to devices compatible with the Cortic AI Hub. Additionally, we introduce the "Service Playground", an application designed to help users experiment with different services without the need to write code.</p>

<h2>Browsing Services in the Store</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Open the Store application on your device.</li>
    <li>Navigate to the "Services" section. <div class="screenshot-placeholder">&lt;screenshot&gt;</div></li>
    <li>Use the search bar or category filters to browse through the list of available services.</li>
    <li>Select a service to view more detailed information. <div class="screenshot-placeholder">&lt;screenshot&gt;</div></li>
</ol>

<h2>Importing Existing Services into a Project</h2>
<ol>
    <li>From the detailed view of a service, click on the "Import" button. <div class="screenshot-placeholder">&lt;screenshot&gt;</div></li>
    <li>Choose the destination project where the service should be imported.</li>
    <li>Click "Confirm" to finalize the import. Once imported, the service will be available in your project workspace.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Deploying Services to Cortic AI Hub Devices</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In the Store, select the service you wish to deploy. <div class="screenshot-placeholder">&lt;screenshot&gt;</div></li>
    <li>Click on the "Deploy" option. This will open the deployment wizard.</li>
    <li>Select the target device managed by Cortic AI Hub. <div class="screenshot-placeholder">&lt;screenshot&gt;</div></li>
    <li>Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the deployment process.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Introducing the Service Playground</h2>
<p>The Service Playground is a dedicated application allowing users to test and experiment with various services without coding. Here's how to set it up and use it:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Visit Service Playground's app page to download the application. <div class="screenshot-placeholder">&lt;screenshot&gt;</div></li>
    <li>Launch the Service Playground. You'll be presented with an interface to add and experiment with services.</li>
    <li>To add a deployed service, click on the "+" button. <div class="screenshot-placeholder">&lt;screenshot&gt;</div></li>
    <li>Select the service from the list of deployed services. Once added, you can interact with the service directly from the Service Playground interface.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>After getting familiar with the basic operations, you might want to explore:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Customizing services to fit specific requirements.</li>

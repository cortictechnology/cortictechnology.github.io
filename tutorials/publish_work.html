        <h2>Introduction</h2>

            This guide is designed to help developers understand the process of packaging and making their apps and
            services available on the Store for others to utilize. The guide elucidates the distinction between posting
            and publishing, and provides a step-by-step procedure to post an app and a service.

        <h2>Difference Between Posting and Publishing</h2>
        <p>
            Posting an app or service essentially means uploading the respective package to the cloud. However, it is
            solely visible on the developer's profile page. Conversely, publishing an app or service entails making it
            available on the Store, thereby enabling other users to download and utilize it. An app or service will
            first need to be posted before it can be published.

            Once you've successfully posted your app or service, publishing it to the Store is the next step to make it
            accessible for the wider audience. The steps for publishing differ slightly based on whether you're
            publishing an app or a service. In both cases, you will need to navigate to the "Profile" section of the
            Store on the Cortic AI Hub.

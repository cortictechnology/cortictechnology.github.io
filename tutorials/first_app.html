    <h1>Creating Your First App</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the guide on creating your first app on the Cortic Platform. Follow the steps below to ensure a smooth
        development experience.</p>

    <h2>1. Setting up Visual Studio Code (VSCode)</h2>
    <p>Begin by ensuring you have the latest version of VSCode installed on your machine.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Download and install VSCode from the official website if you haven't already.</li>
        <li>Ensure you have the "code" command installed to your system's PATH.
            <ul>
                <br>
                <li>For macOS, please follow the instructions <a
                        href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line">here</a>.
                </li>
                <li>For Windows, the "code" command is automatically installed with VSCode. </li>
                <li>For Linux, the "code" command is also automatically installed with VSCode. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>After installation, ensure that you add the "code" command to your system's PATH.
            <ul>
                <br>
                <li>For macOS, enter the commen <code>which code</code> in the terminal. The command should return a
                    path.</li>
                <div class="screenshot"><img src="./assets/first_app/vscode_path_mac.png"></div>
                <li>For Windows, enter the command <code>where code</code> in the command line tool.The command should
                    return two paths, one of which is just a shortcut to the other.
                </li>
                <div class="screenshot"><img src="./assets/first_app/vscode_path_windows.png"></div>
                <li>For Linux, enter the commen <code>which code</code> in the terminal. The command should return a
                    path.</li>
                <div class="screenshot"><img src="./assets/first_app/vscode_path_ubuntu.png"></div>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Copy and paste the "code" path obtained above into the Cortic AI Hub's Settings menu.
        </li>
        <div class="screenshot"><img src="./assets/first_app/vscode_settings.png"></div>
    </ol>

    <h2>2. Create a New App</h2>
    <p>From the Dev Portal, select the option to create a new app. Follow the prompts to name and configure your app's
        initial settings.</p>
    <div class="screenshot-placeholder">&lt;screenshot&gt;</div>
    <p>If you have finished setting up the VSCode path from the previous step, you can press the "Edit App" button to
        open the app in VSCode.</p>
    <h2>3. Understanding the App Directory Structure</h2>
    <p>The app directory is structured in a specific way to facilitate seamless development. Here is a brief overview:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Manifest File (manifest.json):</strong> This file contains metadata about your app. You will need to
            edit this to
            provide specifics about your application.</li>
        <li><strong>Icons:</strong> Your apps default icon is in the assets folder. You may replace it with your own
            icon. Your icon should be 100px by 100px in .png format.</li>
        <li><strong>Conda Environment Setup File (environment.yml):</strong> This file contains the list of dependencies
            required by your
            app. You may add additional dependencies to this file. We strongly recommend you to not use any platform
            specific dependencies in an App. </li>
        <li><strong>Source Code (app_main.py):</strong> This is where the main logic of your app resides. You app should
            inherit from
            the App class and implement several methods: <code>setup</code>, <code>process</code>,
            <code>teardown</code>, and <code>on_exception</code>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    The following sample code illustrates how to do this.
    <pre><code class="language-python">
        # app_main.py

        from cortic_platform.sdk import App # Import the App class from the SDK
        from cortic_platform.sdk.ui.basic_widgets import Container, Image # Import some basic widgets
        from cortic_platform.sdk.app_events import ExceptionTypes # Import the ExceptionTypes enum
        from cortic_platform.sdk.logging import log, LogLevel # Import the log function and LogLevel enum
        from service_registry import *
        
        # Uncomment the following lines to enable debugpy so that you can attach a debugger to the app
        # in VSCode. A vscode configuration is already provided in the .vscode folder. You will need to
        # make sure the port in the vscode configuration is the same as the one specified in the
        # debugpy.listen() call.
        
        # import debugpy
        # debugpy.listen(("0.0.0.0", 5678))
        
        APP_WIDTH=1280 # Specify the width of the app
        APP_HEIGHT=720 # Specify the height of the app
        
        # Create a new app class that inherits from the App class
        class MyFirstApp(App):
            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__()
        

            def setup(self):
                self.background_container = Container([0, 0, APP_WIDTH, APP_HEIGHT])
                self.background_container.background = "#181923"
        
                self.video_frame = Image(
                    [APP_WIDTH * 0.3 / 2, APP_HEIGHT * 0.3 / 2, APP_WIDTH * 0.7, APP_HEIGHT * 0.7],
                    scaling_method="fit",
                )
        
                self.background_container.children.append(self.video_frame)
                
                self.widget_tree.add(self.background_container)
                self.widget_tree.build()
        

            def process(self):
                frame_data = video_capture({"grey_scale": False}, 
                                           service_states={"video_file": "/Users/michael/Downloads/video.mov"})
                task_data = None
                if frame_data is not None:
                    face_detection_data = face_landmarks({"camera_input": frame_data,
                                                          "draw_landmarks": True})
                    if face_detection_data is not None:
                        task_data = face_detection_data.get_data()
                if task_data and task_data is not ExceptionTypes:
                    self.video_frame.update_image(task_data["frame"])
                self.widget_tree.update()
        
                
            def on_exception(self, exception, exception_data=None):
                log("Exception occurred: " + str(exception_data), log_level=LogLevel.Error)
        

            def teardown(self):
                log("Tearing down the App", log_level=LogLevel.Info)
        </code></pre>

    <p>Here is an explanation of what each method of the above code does.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>setup:</strong> This method is called once when the app is started. You can use this method to
            initialize any variables or widgets that you may need. In the above example, we initialize a background
            container and an image widget. We also add the image widget to the background container and add the
            background container to the widget tree. Finally, we call the build method of the widget tree to build the
            App's UI.</li>
        <li><strong>process:</strong> This method is called repeatedly while the app is running. You can use this
            method to perform any processing on the data that you receive from the services. In the above example, we
            call the video_capture service to get a frame from the video file and then call the face_landmarks service
            to detect facial landmarks in the frame. Notice that we pass the frame data from the video_capture service
            to the face_landmarks service. This is how you can chain services together. Finally, we update the image
            widget with the frame data returned by the face_landmarks service.</li>
        <li><strong>on_exception:</strong> This method is called when an exception occurs. You can use this method to
            handle exceptions. In the above example, we log the exception.</li>
        <li><strong>teardown:</strong> This method is called once when the app is stopped. You can use this method to
            perform any cleanup operations. In the above example, we log a message to indicate that the app is being
            torn down.</li>


        <h2>4. Importing some Services</h2>
        <p>Head over to the Store and search for the "Video Capture" and "Face Landmarks" services. Follow the
            instructions shown in the screenshots below to import the services into your app.</p>
        <div class="screenshot-placeholder">&lt;screenshot&gt;</div>

        <h2>5. Inspecting the service_registry.py File</h2>
        <p>Once you've imported the service, you can find its autogenerated wrapper function by inspecting the
            <code>service_registry.py</code> file. Note that the function name is the same as the ones you see in the
            <code>app_main.py</code> file shown above. This is how you can call the services from your app. You can pass
            the parameters to the service in a dictionary when calling the function. The keys of the dictionary are the
            names of the parameters and the values are the values of the parameters.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-placeholder">&lt;screenshot&gt;</div>

        <h2>6. Running the App and Inspecting Logs</h2>
        <p>Run your app by pressing the "Run" button. You should see the video playing in the app window. You should
            also see the facial landmarks being detected in the video frame. To troubleshoot or get insights into the
            application's performance, open the console window and inspect the logs.</p>
        <div class="screenshot-placeholder">&lt;screenshot&gt;</div>

        <h2>7. Checking the Device Page</h2>
        <p>Visit the device page to view the current status of the Services being used by the app. You should see the
            Video Capture and Face Landmarks services are in the "Processing" state. This means that the services are
            currently being used by the app. You can also view the logs for each service on the device page.</p>

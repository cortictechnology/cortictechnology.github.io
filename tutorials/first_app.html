    <h1>Creating Your First App</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the guide on creating your first app on the Cortic Platform. Follow the steps below to ensure a smooth development experience.</p>

    <h2>1. Setting up Visual Studio Code (VSCode)</h2>
    <p>Begin by ensuring you have the latest version of VSCode installed on your machine.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Download and install VSCode from the official website if you haven't already.</li>
        <li>Open VSCode and navigate to the extensions section. Ensure you have the "code command" extension installed.</li>
        <li>After installation, ensure that you add the "code" command to your system's PATH.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>2. Create a New App</h2>
    <p>From the Dev Portal, select the option to create a new app. Follow the prompts to name and configure your app's initial settings.</p>

    <h2>3. Understanding the App Directory Structure</h2>
    <p>The app directory is structured in a specific way to facilitate seamless development. Here is a brief overview:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Manifest File:</strong> This file contains metadata about your app. You will need to edit this to provide specifics about your application.</li>
        <li><strong>Icons:</strong> Your apps default icon is in the asset folder. You may replace it with your own icon.  Your icon should be 100px by 100px in .png format.</li>
        <li><strong>Source Code:</strong> This is where the main logic of your app resides. You app should inherit from the App class and implement several methods: <code>setup</code>, <code>process</code>, <code>teardown</code>, and <code>on_exception</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    The following sample code illustrates how to do this.

    <p><code>sample code</code></p>

    <p>Here is an explanation of what each method of the above code does.</p>

    <h2>4. Importing the face_landmarks Service</h2>
    <p>Head over to the Store and search for the "face_landmarks" service. Follow the instructions to import it into your app.</p>
    <div class="screenshot-placeholder">&lt;screenshot&gt;</div>

    <h2>5. Inspecting the service_registry.py File</h2>
    <p>Once you've imported the service, you can find its autogenerated wrapper function by inspecting the <code>service_registry.py</code> file. Note down the function name as you'll use it in your app.</p>
    <div class="screenshot-placeholder">&lt;screenshot&gt;</div>

    <h2>6. Running the App and Inspecting Logs</h2>
    <p>Run your app using the provided execution command. To troubleshoot or get insights into the application's performance, open the console window and inspect the logs.</p>
    <div class="screenshot-placeholder">&lt;screenshot&gt;</div>

    <h2>7. Checking the Device Page</h2>
    <p>Visit the device page to view the current status of the face_landmarks service. This gives a real-time update on its performance and any detected landmarks.</p>

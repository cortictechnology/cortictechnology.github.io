    <h1>Creating a New Service</h1>
    <p>This guide aims to instruct developers on creating a new service by subclassing from the base "Service" class
        available in the Cortic Platform SDK.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>For effective integration into the Cortic Platform, it is crucial for your service to implement three core
        methods:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>activate</code></li>
        <li><code>process</code></li>
        <li><code>deactivate</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Platform Independent Services</h2>
    <p>Developing a service that remains independent of the underlying platform provides flexibility and broadens
        compatibility. There are three primary methods to achieve this:</p>

    <h3>1. Using Main Processor for Computations</h3>
    <p>By focusing on the main processor for all computations, you eschew the need for specialized hardware. This
        ensures a generic compatibility across platforms.</p>

    <h3>2. Leveraging Python Packages</h3>
    <p>Python packages such as PyTorch can support multiple backends. By utilizing such a package, you can abstract away
        the specifics of the backend and ensure your service works seamlessly across various platforms.</p>

    <h3>3. Conditional Requirements in <code>requirements.txt</code></h3>
    <p>Edit the <code>requirements.txt</code> to add conditional requirements specific to each platform. Additionally,
        detect the current platform within your application to execute tasks that are platform-specific.</p>

    <h2>Sample Service: Face Detection</h2>
    <p>To better understand the creation of a generic service, let's examine a face detection service for each of the
        scenarios mentioned above:</p>

    <h3>1. Main Processor-Based Face Detection</h3>
    <p>Detail the steps and logic of utilizing the main processor for face detection. Highlight any challenges or
        nuances specific to this approach.</p>
    <div class="screenshot-placeholder">&lt;screenshot&gt;</div>

    <h3>2. PyTorch Backend-Based Face Detection</h3>
    <p>Illustrate how PyTorch or similar packages can be used to abstract backend specifics and develop a face detection
        service that remains platform independent.</p>
    <div class="screenshot-placeholder">&lt;screenshot&gt;</div>

    <h3>3. Conditional Requirements-Based Face Detection</h3>
    <p>Explain how to structure the <code>requirements.txt</code> for platform-specific needs and how to detect the
        current platform within the application to execute relevant tasks.</p>
    <div class="screenshot-placeholder">&lt;screenshot&gt;</div>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>Now that you have successfully created a service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Consider optimizing the service for better performance.</li>
        <li>Explore integrating additional functionalities to enhance the service capabilities.</li>
        <li>Look into the advanced features of the Cortic Platform SDK for more sophisticated implementations.</li>
    </ul>
